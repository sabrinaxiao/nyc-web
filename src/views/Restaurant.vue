          <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> New York is most known for its New York pizza. Although Prince Street Pizza isn’t your regular New York slice, its famous pepperoni Sicilian slice is one of the best quality slices you will ever get. You know a pizzeria is good if their whole wall is covered with photographs of the owner standing with famous celebrities from over the 8 years they have been opened. Since it is close to Soho, it is the perfect place to grab a bite after a shopping spree. Be aware that most pizzerias won’t have a sitting area, so many people grab the slice to go.  </h1>
