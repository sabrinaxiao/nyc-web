The museum designers decided not to include interpretive explanations, but rather let the direct testimonials from the ­people who had experienced it to tell the story. This museum even has emotional exits, which allow visitors who may be traumatized or overwhelmed to be able to exit to a safe and neutral zone. The memorial is located at the site of the former World Trade Center and features the largest man made waterfall in North America. The sides have engravings of the names of those who have lost their lives during 9/11. </h1>
