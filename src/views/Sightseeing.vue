          <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> Times Square is one of the most popular tourist locations in the city. Even at night, the streets are bright from the billboards that illuminate from store tops. Stores attract customers by having flashy storefronts and signs. Times Square not only has a wide variety of retail stores and restaurants, but also it is the location of the infamous Broadway shows that make NYC the center of the best theoretical productions. You would see people dressed in Sesame Street animal costumes or the Statue of Liberty, or even only be covered in body paint. The hustle and bustle adds to the chaotic, flashy environment of Times Square, which makes it special.   </h1>

          <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> If you are visiting the 9/11 Memorial/Museum, then you must visit the Oculus. It is within walking distance and is the perfect place to take pictures. Its unique building shape is what distinguishes the Oculus from other places in the city. The white rod-like structure features a variety of luxury stores inside. There is also a walkway connecting the Oculus to Brookfield Place, which is a mall with high-end stores, like Gucci and Michael Kors. There is also a food court with average priced salads, burgers, pizza, and tacos. There is also a large, tiered staircase connecting the food court to the luxury stores and many locals and tourists alike enjoy sitting there to catch up with friends or to eat their lunches.  </h1>

            <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> Unlike regular parks, the High Line is built on a historic, elevated rail line spanning through the West Side of Manhattan. There are flower and shrub gardens decorating the sides of the promenade. There are staircases and overlooks to enable visitors to have a view while walking down the High Line. Other than public art on the walls and the food vendors, the main attraction is the view of the city skyline that surrounds this park. If you walk far enough, you would be able to reach the Vessel, which is one of the newest installations in the city, located at Hudson Yards. It is a large honey-comb like structure with 154 interconnecting flights of stairs, which you can climb for fun.  </h1>

          <v-flex xs10 md6>
            <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> Coney Island is no Bahamas’ beach and may be littered with trash, but this beach and amusement park combo is a rare find in the city. You may have heard of the famous “Coney Island Hot Dog” and it’s because Coney Island’s  Nathan’s Famous Hot Dogs store is the busiest restaurant in the area. The beach will be filled with families and be blasting music over loudspeakers, while aggressive seagulls try to steal your food. Right next to the boardwalk and beach is Luna Park, a small amusement park with arcades and roller coasters. Luna Park is loud with game tunes and bright from flashy lights. Coney Island is especially beautiful during sunsets.  </h1>
            <h1 class="subtitle-1 font-weight-bold my-2">Must see: </h1>
            <h1 class="subtitle-1 "> Fireworks. Every Friday night from end of June to mid August, there is a fireworks show that locals come to watch. It will be crowded on the boardwalk, so getting there before the show starts and securing a spot on the beach near where the fireworks are being lit will give you a good view.  </h1>
