          <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> Central Park is the largest park in New York City, stretching 51 blocks and separating the Upper West and Upper East parts of the city. It is a little nature getaway, while still being surrounded by skyscrapers on either side of the park. There are beautiful arches and bridges scattered all around and big lawns for picnicking with loved ones. There is even a castle embedded deep in the park. You can visit the Central Park Zoo or ride the carousel or paddle down the lake in a wooden boat or even ride on a horse drawn carriage. The best time to visit is cherry blossom season, when the park would have endless rows of cherry blossom trees and pink petals fluttering down.  </h1>

        <v-flex xs10 md6>
          <h1 class="subtitle-1 my-3"> Governor’s Island is a mini getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Hill is one of the best views of the Statue of Liberty and offers plenty of scenic views for photography opportunities. The island has been recently opened to the public, for it has been reconstructed from its original use of being a military base for the US Army and the Coast Guard. Besides the few eerie looking houses left behind, there are bike hills, galleries, and gardens residing next to a historic castle. You can even ride a surrey with friends while circling the promenade. Governor’s Island is only open from May 1 to October 31 and you can only get there by ferry. </h1>
